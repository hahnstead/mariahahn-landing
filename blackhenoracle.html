    <h1>Black Hen Oracle</h1>
    <p class="tagline">The myth, the land, the work of hands and bone.</p>

    <p>This space holds everything that lives beyond the page—ritual, chickens, dirt under fingernails, sweat, grief, ritual tools, and the messy beauty of building a life. It's where my world takes shape in feathers, soil, scars, and spells.</p>

    <p>It’s a record of what I’m tending: the flock, the garden, the body, the mind. It’s what doesn’t fit neatly into fiction, but still belongs to the story.</p>
