  <h1>The Jack Year - 1997 (Excerpt)</h1>
  <p class="tagline">By Maria Hahn · July 2025</p>

  <p>Maria had just turned fourteen when Mother burst into her room, voice bright and breathless, like a teenager telling a secret.  </p>
  <p>“Guess what?! Jack let me smoke pot!”</p>
  <p>Maria blinked up from her bed, where she’d been half-listening to music - probably Queen, maybe Vivaldi, possibly </i>Middle of Nowhere</i> by Hanson - while doodling or writing or flipping through a book. It all blurred together these days. She lived in her head more than anywhere else. Outside, a door slammed, and then the faint squawk of someone yelling at their kid in the E-building. Every room in every unit looked the same - white walls, brownish carpet, old iron railings that peeled and smelled like blood if you picked at it long enough. </p>
  <p>She stared at Mother, who stood grinning in the doorway as if the world hadn’t just tilted. Maria’s brain tried to catch up. Jack. Pot. Mother. Smoking it.</p>
  <p>“I want to smoke pot,” she said, like it had just occurred to her, even though she’d known - knew deep in her bones long before she even knew what weed <i>was</i> - that it was meant for her. She didn’t fully understand why. She just did.</p>
  <p>Mother paused. Maria could see the thoughts moving behind her eyes, the old gears grinding against the new. Just a few months ago, Mother wouldn’t let them drink <i>iced tea</i> - wouldn’t touch it herself, not with the Word of Wisdom etched into her spine. </p>
  <p>Then Mother nodded, casual as if they were discussing buying socks. “Okay. I’ll ask Jack if you can smoke pot and I’ll get back to you.” </p>
  <p>The days after that were a haze. Not the good kind, not yet. Just ordinary sunlit days crawling past while she waited for the thing to happen.</p>
  <p>And then it did.</p>
