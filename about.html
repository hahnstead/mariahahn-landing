        <p><strong>Maria Hahn</strong> writes American gothic fiction from the edge of the Midwest, where she lives with her family, a flock of chickens, and a hundred half-finished projects. She holds a degree in anthropology from the Ohio State University, where she studied human stories in all their messy, mythic detail.</p>
        <p>She now works in special education, supporting middle schoolers with mild to moderate disabilities—an unexpected calling that fits. Her fiction lives in the margins, blending dirt, ghosts, and memory with old wounds and deep, feral roots.</p>
        <p>She writes under the ancestral name Hahn—a surname that has carried her family from 1700s Rhineland forests to Oklahoma land runs to modern Ohio creeks.</p>
