  <h1>Quiet Things</h1>
  <p class="tagline">By Maria Hahn · June 2025</p>

  <p>The coffee urn hissed like a boiler on its last legs, filling the night shift with bitter steam. Mabel Osborn wiped the counter in slow circles, pretending the rag could polish sorrow right out of Formica. A single bulb buzzed overhead; the rest of Main Street was already dark, except for the bank's clock, its glass face rimmed in flickering neon, ticking toward 12:47 A.M.</p>
  <p>She thought she was alone until she heard it—a soft, rattling breath from the last booth. Mabel’s spine snapped straight. The booths were supposed to be empty; she’d shooed out the poker drunks an hour ago. She inched closer, fingers tightening around her rag like a weapon.</p>
  <p>A woman lay curled on the cracked green vinyl, coat for a blanket, carpet‑bag tucked under her knees. Strands of chestnut hair splashed across a face lined more by exhaustion than age. Mabel recognized her dimly—Ruth Royer, the butcher’s wife from two towns over. Or ex‑wife now, if the gossip was true. Ruth Dinsmore, back then.</p>
  <p>“Ruth?” Mabel kept her voice gentle, the way she spoke to stray cats. “Sweetheart, we’re closed.”</p>
  <p>One brown eye cracked open. It was swollen purple at the edge. “Sorry—didn’t mean to spook you.” Her voice was ragged silk. “Just needed to warm up.”</p>
  <p>Mabel set the rag aside, grabbed the coffee pot. “You hungry?”</p>
  <p>Ruth tried to sit, winced, failed. “I… ain’t got money.”</p>
  <p>Mabel poured two cups anyway. “Good thing coffee grows on trees around here.” She slid into the opposite seat. The heat of the mug seeped into their hands as Mabel passed it over. Up close she could see the split lip, the fading fingerprint bruises on Ruth’s wrist.</p>
  <p>For a long minute they sipped without speaking. Outside, wind rattled the café windows. The stock market had crashed three days ago; the whole town felt like a crate dropped from a truck, contents still rattling.</p>
  <p>Ruth broke the silence. “I’ll clear out before the morning crowd. Just let me thaw a bit.”</p>
  <p>Mabel shook her head. “Mrs. Bergen keeps an empty cot at the boarding house. ’Til my sister comes to town, it’s yours. No charge.”</p>
  <p>Ruth’s eyes filled, then hardened with something like pride. “Why?”</p>
  <p>“Because you look like you need someone to say yes.”</p>
  <p>That answer did it. Ruth’s shoulders sagged, the tension leaking out in a shaky exhale. She pressed the coffee cup to her cheek like a child with a fever and whispered, “Thank you, Mabel. You’re a godsend.”</p>
  <p>Mabel felt something warm bloom in her chest—a dangerous, hopeful bloom. She’d been called many names in her life, but never a godsend. She gestured to the pie case. “Apple or custard?”</p>
  <p>Ruth smiled for the first time, and Mabel decided she’d never seen a smile quite so bright.</p>
  <p>That was how it began.</p>

  
<p class="divider">-✦-</p>


  <p>By late January, Mabel and Ruth had fallen into a rhythm. The café’s drafty kitchen buzzed with the slap of biscuit dough, the hiss of potatoes in lard, and Ruth’s laughter—louder now, rounder. She wore borrowed aprons and tied her chestnut hair in a neat scarf like the other girls, though her lipstick stayed on even through lunch rush. Mabel found herself laughing more often too, especially when Ruth would lean in and whisper wicked impressions of the town’s most pious patrons.</p>
  <p>At night, they shared dry toast and weak coffee at the two-burner stove in Mabel’s boarding room, their knees touching under the small table. Above them, tacked to the wall, was a faded photograph of two girls in pinafores, standing in a garden. One was Mabel, stiff-backed and solemn; the younger one, smiling, was her sister June. Their mother stood behind them, hands firm on their shoulders. "Be good, don't cause trouble," she'd always said. June had caused plenty - run off to Chicago with a jazz musician, only sent postcards now. Ruth noticed the photo once and asked about it, but never brought it up again. Just like she'd never asked why Mabel had a biology textbook hidden under her cot or why she kept an unopened letter tucked into her Bible - the one with the college seal she couldn't afford to answer. Mabel thought it strange. Most people ask about families, once. </p>
  <p>By the time Ruth started sweet-talking Frank Zeigler over lemon pie and smirking compliments, the staff had taken to calling her "Miss Honeybutter." Mabel didn’t mind. Frank was a kind man with a slow smile and wide hands, always tipping better than he should. Ruth deserved someone steady.</p>
  <p>But then came the first crack.</p>
  <p>One night, Mabel returned home with a dog-eared copy of _Coming of Age in Samoa_ by Margaret Mead, borrowed from the library. She was buzzing to read it - curious about other ways people lived and grew up, hungry for something beyond the edges of the town. Ruth squinted at the cover, then burst into laughter.</p>
  <p>"You really think they’ll let a waitress into the halls of science?" she said. "Lord, Mabel. You’re sweet, but you ain't special."</p>
  <p>And just like that, Mabel’s stomach dropped.</p>
  <p>A few days later, Mabel sat cross-legged on her bed under the thin lamplight, reading a passage about Samoan adolescence out loud - not to anyone, just softly to herself. Ruth came out of the washroom towel-drying her hair, paused, and tilted her head like a bird.</p>
  <p>"What's that one about again? That Samoa book?"</p>
  <p>"It's about how girls come of age in a different culture," Mabel said, careful not to sound too excited. "Margaret Mead did fieldwork there, lived with the families, watched how they raised children. It's - well - it's honest. Real."</p>
  <p>Ruth snorted and dropped onto the edge of the bed. "So they just let some lady poke around island girls and call it science? Sounds nosy to me."</p>
  <p>Mabel set the book in her lap. "She was trying to understand if the way we grow up is the only way. If pain and pressure are really necessary for girls to grow into women."</p>
  <p>"Well of course they are," Ruth said. "Pain's how you know you're doing it right. That Mead woman sounds like she ran off to the tropics to avoid real life." </p>
  <p>She stood, running the towel through her hair again. "I'll bet she never had two kids and a black eye at twenty."</p>
  <p>Mabel said nothing. She just turned back to the page, but the words blurred.</p>
  <p>"She's probably some rich girl with soft hands," Ruth added. "Writing about coconuts and naked teenagers while the rest of us scrub the grease trap." </p>
  <p>Mabel didn't argue. But she didn't pick the book up again that night, either. </p>
  <p>The second crack came the next week, when Ruth refused a lentil stew Mabel made from pantry scraps.</p>
  <p>"Tastes like something fed to mules in a Quaker prison," she’d said, sliding the bowl away. "You and your rabbit food. You keep cooking like this, and no man with sense will stick around. Maybe that's why yours left."</p>
  <p>She still smiled, but Mabel could feel it—something shifting under the surface, a current pulling away from shore.</p>
  <p>And yet, Mabel laughed anyway. She told herself Ruth was just tired. Just teasing. Just not used to kindness without a catch.</p>
  <p>She told herself a lot of things.</p>
  

 <p class="divider">-✦-</p>


  <p>The wedding was small but respectable. Ruth wore pale blue and carried a bouquet of dried hydrangeas. Frank’s brick bungalow sat on the east side of town -close enough to the mill that he could walk, far enough to avoid the clang of machinery. The place had a trimmed hedge, a grapevine arbor, and a front porch with two gliders that faced the sunset. Mabel had helped hem Ruth’s dress and baked a blackberry cobbler for the reception. She remembered the smile Ruth gave her that day - grateful, but already distant, like someone who knew she wouldn’t be returning borrowed things.</p>
  <p>In the weeks that followed, Mabel still saw Ruth—just less often. The café shifts no longer overlapped. Ruth had stopped taking leftovers home. Mabel dropped by one afternoon with a jar of preserves, but Ruth met her at the door in a rush, brushing flour from her apron and murmuring, "Oh, sweetie, I wish I could sit, but I’ve got Frank’s mother coming. She don’t like surprises."</p>
  <p>That Sunday, Mabel dressed in her nicest blouse—plum-colored, with hand-sewn cuffs—and walked the mile and a half to Ruth’s. The windows glowed with lamplight and laughter. She knocked, waited, then peeked through the parlor window.</p>
  <p>Inside, four women sat at a bridge table under a fringed lamp, hands fluttering with cards and chatter. Ruth wore pearls and was laughing, hard. Mabel stood there for a long time before she turned around. </p>
  <p>She hadn't been invited.</p>
  <p>That walk home felt longer than the one there. The sky had gone gray, and frost clung to the grass like static. Mabel’s thoughts wandered, then settled—she’d seen this pattern before. The bright ones, the broken ones, the ones who cling to her just long enough to rebuild. Ruth was just the latest in a long line. Mabel could see them all now—Anna from school, Jo from the cannery, Lucille with her scarred knuckles and sweet tooth. Each one had taken the best of Mabel’s patience, her quiet steadiness, then vanished when life started smiling again. She felt her fingers brush the spot where a ring used to sit, a gesture her body hadn't unlearned. </p>
  <p>She remembered the letter in her Bible, the college seal she'd once traced with her fingertip, the ring she'd slipped off and tucked into the back of a drawer. No one had ever asked about them. Not Ruth. Not any of them.</p>
  <p>She let herself wonder, just once, if she’d ever be anything more than a stepping stone.</p>
  <p>Then she put the thought away and kept walking.</p>


 <p class="divider">-✦-</p>


  <p>Mabel first heard about the Zeiglers’ party from a busboy at the café.</p>
  <p>"You going?" he asked while scraping a plate. "Whole town's headed over Saturday. They’ve got a piano now. Ruth’s been teaching herself from sheet music—pretty little thing in the parlor."</p>
  <p>Mabel didn’t answer. She just wiped the same spot on the counter until it shined.</p>
  <p>On Saturday evening, she walked past the house on her way back from the corner store, holding a sack with coffee grounds, a bar of soap, and a bundle of green onions. It was supposed to be a detour. A curiosity. Just passing by.</p>
  <p>But the porch was lit up like a stage set. The gliders were gone, replaced by wicker chairs and cut flowers. Inside, people mingled with punch cups and paper napkins. Ruth stood at the center of it all, one hand on Frank’s shoulder, the other gesturing mid-story. She looked exactly like someone who had never once needed saving.</p>
  <p>Mabel didn’t linger. She kept walking, past the houses with their porch lights glowing like low lanterns, past the edge of the good sidewalk, past the turn that would’ve taken her home. She stopped at the bridge.</p>
  <p>It wasn’t much of a bridge. Just wood planks and railings over a culvert, where the water barely moved. But she stood there a long time, listening.</p>
  <p>She thought of the stories Ruth once told about the life she'd left behind, the laughter she polished for company, the silences she never explained. Of all the things Mabel had done—quietly, without expecting anything in return. And how easy it was, in the end, to forget a woman like that.</p>
  <p>The night air stung her eyes. Or maybe that was just the truth settling in.</p>
  <p>She wasn’t angry. Not exactly.</p>
  <p>She just felt the ache of something spent. Not wasted—no, she'd given freely. But there was a difference, she was realizing, between being needed and being seen.</p>
  <p>Somewhere behind her, someone at the party started singing. Ruth’s voice didn’t rise above the others. It didn’t have to. Mabel could still hear it in her head.</p>
  <p>She reached into the paper sack, pulled out the green onions, and snapped one in half. The sharp scent filled the cold air like something alive.</p>
  <p>Then she turned and walked home, lighter for reasons she couldn’t quite name.</p>
