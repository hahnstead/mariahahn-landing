  <h1>Quiet Things</h1>
  <p class="tagline">By Maria Hahn · June 2025</p>

  <p>The coffee urn hissed like a boiler on its last legs, filling the night shift with bitter steam. Mabel Osborn wiped the counter in slow circles, pretending the rag could polish sorrow right out of Formica. A single bulb buzzed overhead; the rest of Main Street was already dark, except for the bank's clock, its glass face rimmed in flickering neon, ticking toward 12:47 A.M.</p>
  <p>She thought she was alone until she heard it—a soft, rattling breath from the last booth. Mabel’s spine snapped straight. The booths were supposed to be empty; she’d shooed out the poker drunks an hour ago. She inched closer, fingers tightening around her rag like a weapon.</p>
  <p>A woman lay curled on the cracked green vinyl, coat for a blanket, carpet‑bag tucked under her knees. Strands of chestnut hair splashed across a face lined more by exhaustion than age. Mabel recognized her dimly—Ruth Royer, the butcher’s wife from two towns over. Or ex‑wife now, if the gossip was true. Ruth Dinsmore, back then.</p>
  <p>“Ruth?” Mabel kept her voice gentle, the way she spoke to stray cats. “Sweetheart, we’re closed.”</p>
  <p>One brown eye cracked open. It was swollen purple at the edge. “Sorry—didn’t mean to spook you.” Her voice was ragged silk. “Just needed to warm up.”</p>
  <p>Mabel set the rag aside, grabbed the coffee pot. “You hungry?”</p>
  <p>Ruth tried to sit, winced, failed. “I… ain’t got money.”</p>
  <p>Mabel poured two cups anyway. “Good thing coffee grows on trees around here.” She slid into the opposite seat. The heat of the mug seeped into their hands as Mabel passed it over. Up close she could see the split lip, the fading fingerprint bruises on Ruth’s wrist.</p>
  <p>For a long minute they sipped without speaking. Outside, wind rattled the café windows. The stock market had crashed three days ago; the whole town felt like a crate dropped from a truck, contents still rattling.</p>
  <p>Ruth broke the silence. “I’ll clear out before the morning crowd. Just let me thaw a bit.”</p>
  <p>Mabel shook her head. “Mrs. Bergen keeps an empty cot at the boarding house. ’Til my sister comes to town, it’s yours. No charge.”</p>
  <p>Ruth’s eyes filled, then hardened with something like pride. “Why?”</p>
  <p>“Because you look like you need someone to say yes.”</p>
  <p>That answer did it. Ruth’s shoulders sagged, the tension leaking out in a shaky exhale. She pressed the coffee cup to her cheek like a child with a fever and whispered, “Thank you, Mabel. You’re a godsend.”</p>
  <p>Mabel felt something warm bloom in her chest—a dangerous, hopeful bloom. She’d been called many names in her life, but never a godsend. She gestured to the pie case. “Apple or custard?”</p>
  <p>Ruth smiled for the first time, and Mabel decided she’d never seen a smile quite so bright.</p>
  <p>That was how it began.</p>
